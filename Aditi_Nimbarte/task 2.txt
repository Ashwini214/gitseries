How git workflow works?
Git works on four fundamental elements 
1.Workspace-working directory
2.Index(stage)-project is added and ready to be commited
3.Local Repository-it resides in our systems and contains all the files with their commit history
4.Remote Repository-repository on the server to which every member will have access

What are the different stages of git project as commit,add?
=>different stages of git project are modified,staged and commit.
1.modified-we can make changes to copy of our project without hampering the orignal code
2.staged-the files which are added and ready to be commited but not yet commited 
3.commit-the staged files are commited to local repository

Is it possible to do a git commit before git add?if no,explain why?
=> No,It is not possible because as per git workflow first we have to add file from working directory to local index and then it can be commited. 

why is git diff is used?
=>git diff is used to track the changes made in the project.It compares the commited file with the file in staged area

Can we leave the commit messages as blank?
=>Yes,it can be done by using *git commit -a--allow-empty-messagw-m"" *
