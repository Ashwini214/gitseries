Q1 ) How a git workflow works ?

Workflow are these 4 :  Workspace   Index -  local repository - remote repository.
Firstly clone repo if not done yet. If we have a file in our workspace , three can be 3 possibe states :
1)	Committed – which means latest changes in our data Is safely stored in local repository .
2)	Modified – means changes done in data will not be reflected in local repository.
3)	Staged – means file is the part of index, i.e. to be considered in next commit.

Q2 ) What are different stages of a git project as  commit,add?

•	To get access to the repository : git command followed by URL . Ex : git (http://......)
•	To add a file in workspace to index : add command is used , which is not yet committed.
•	So, to commit all the changes in local repo : commit –a  command is used.
•	Push will allow the changes to be visible to the other users.
•	To get changes directly to workspace we pull it. It work as (fetch+merge).

Q3 ) Is it possible to do a git commit before git add. If you have made any changes? Explain why?

	It is not possible to do a git commit before git add. Commits can be made on added data only. All the changes in working directory and then save the changes to the repo through commit command.

Q4) Why is git diff used?

This command is used to check the difference between the files in the stage and in the workspace.

 Q5). Can we leave the commit message as blank?

Yes we can do it by using the below command :
git commit -a --allow-empty-message -m ""
